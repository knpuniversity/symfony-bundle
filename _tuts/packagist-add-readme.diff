+# Hello LoremIpsumBundle!
+
+LoremIpsumBundle is a way for you to generate "fake text" into
+your Symfony application, but with *just* a little bit more joy
+than your normal lorem ipsum.
+
+Install the package with:
+
+```console
+composer require knpuniversity/lorem-ipsum-bundle --dev
+```
+
+And... that's it! If you're *not* using Symfony Flex, you'll also
+need to enable the `KnpU\LoremIpsumBundle\KnpULoremIpsumBundle`
+in your `AppKernel.php` file.
+
+## Usage
+
+This bundle provides a single service for generating fake text, which
+you can autowire by using the `KnpUIpsum` type-hint:
+
+```php
+// src/Controller/SomeController.php
+
+use KnpU\LoremIpsumBundle\KnpUIpsum;
+// ...
+
+class SomeController
+{
+    public function index(KnpUIpsum $knpUIpsum)
+    {
+        $fakeText = $knpUIpsum->getParagraphs();
+
+        // ...
+    }
+}
+```
+
+You can also access this service directly using the id
+`knpu_lorem_ipsum.knpu_ipsum`.
+
+## Configuration
+
+A few parts of the generated text can be configured directly by
+creating a new `config/packages/knpu_lorem_ipsum.yaml` file. The
+default values are:
+
+```yaml
+# config/packages/knpu_lorem_ipsum.yaml
+knpu_lorem_ipsum:
+
+    # Whether or not you believe in unicorns
+    unicorns_are_real:    true
+
+    # How much do you like sunshine?
+    min_sunshine:         3
+```
+
+## Extending the Word List
+
+If you're feeling *especially* creative and excited, you can add 
+your *own* words to the word generator!
+
+To do that, create a class that implements `WordProviderInterface`:
+
+```php
+namespace App\Service;
+
+use KnpU\LoremIpsumBundle\WordProviderInterface;
+
+class CustomWordProvider implements WordProviderInterface
+{
+    public function getWordList(): array
+    {
+        return ['beach'];
+    }
+}
+```
+
+And... that's it! If you're using the standard service configuration,
+your new class will automatically be registered as a service and used
+by the system. If you are not, you will need to register this class
+as a service and tag it with `knpu_ipsum_word_provider`.
+
+## Contributing
+
+Of course, open source is fueled by everyone's ability to give just a little bit
+of their time for the greater good. If you'd like to see a feature or add some of
+your *own* happy words, awesome! Tou can request it - but creating a pull request
+is an even better way to get things done.
+
+Either way, please feel comfortable submitting issues or pull requests: all contributions
+and questions are warmly appreciated :).
